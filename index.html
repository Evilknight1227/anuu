                    My dearest Anushree,<br><br>
                    Every moment spent with you is like a beautiful dream come true. You are the melody in my heart, the light in my darkest days, and the reason behind my every smile. No distance can ever diminish the love I have for you, for you are always in my thoughts and forever in my heart. ðŸ’–<br><br>
                    I cherish every memory we've created, and I eagerly await the days when we can make even more. You are my forever and always, my love, my heart, my everything.I love you beyond words, beyond time, beyond distance. You are my greatest adventure, my sweetest love, my home.  
                    No matter where life takes us, my heart will always find its way back to you.ðŸ’•
